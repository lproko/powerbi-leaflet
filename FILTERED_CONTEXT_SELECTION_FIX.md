# Filtered Context Selection Fix

## Problem Description

When Power BI has other filters applied and you click on a marker for the first time, the filter would apply to Power BI but the map would show all markers again instead of respecting the current filtered context. This happened because the selection logic didn't properly handle filtered data contexts.

## Root Cause

The issue was that when Power BI has filters applied, the visual's data context changes, but the marker selection logic was treating an empty selection result as "show all markers" instead of "show only markers in the current filtered context."

## Fix Applied

### 1. **Context-Aware Selection Logic**

- Added `getCurrentDataContext()` method to understand what data is currently filtered
- Added `compareSelectionIds()` method for robust selection ID comparison
- Added `showOnlyCurrentContextMarkers()` method to show only filtered markers

### 2. **Improved Marker Click Handler**

```typescript
// Before: Always showed all markers when selection was empty
if (ids.length === 0) {
  this.updateMarkersVisibility([this.selectionIds[i]]);
}

// After: Checks if marker is in current filtered context
if (ids.length === 0) {
  const isInCurrentContext = currentDataContext.some((contextId) => {
    return this.compareSelectionIds(this.selectionIds[i], contextId);
  });

  if (isInCurrentContext) {
    this.updateMarkersVisibility([this.selectionIds[i]]);
  } else {
    this.updateMarkersVisibility(currentDataContext);
  }
}
```

### 3. **Context-Aware Clear Selection**

- Map click and clear selection now respect the current filtered context
- Instead of showing all markers, shows only markers in the current filter

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Filtered Context

1. Apply a filter in Power BI (e.g., filter by country, date, etc.)
2. Click on a marker in the filtered data
3. **Expected**: Only the clicked marker should be visible
4. **Before Fix**: All markers would become visible

### Test 2: Click Outside Filtered Context

1. Apply a filter in Power BI
2. Click on a marker that's not in the filtered data
3. **Expected**: All markers in the current filtered context should be visible
4. **Before Fix**: All markers would become visible

### Test 3: Multiple Selections in Filtered Context

1. Apply a filter in Power BI
2. Hold Ctrl/Cmd and click multiple markers in the filtered data
3. **Expected**: Only the clicked markers should be visible
4. **Before Fix**: This worked correctly

### Test 4: Clear Selection in Filtered Context

1. Apply a filter in Power BI
2. Click on a marker to select it
3. Click on empty map area to clear selection
4. **Expected**: All markers in the current filtered context should be visible
5. **Before Fix**: All markers would become visible

### Test 5: Power BI Filter Integration

1. Apply a filter in Power BI
2. Click on a marker in the filtered data
3. Check if the Power BI filter is applied correctly
4. **Expected**: Power BI should filter to show only the selected data
5. **Before Fix**: Filter worked but map showed wrong markers

## Console Logs to Monitor

Look for these log messages in the browser console:

```
"Marker clicked: index X, selectionId: [object]"
"Current data context: [array of selection IDs]"
"Selection result: [array of selection IDs]"
"Marker in current context - showing only this marker"
"Marker not in current context - showing all current markers"
"Showing only markers in current filtered context"
"Updating markers visibility: {totalMarkers: X, selectedIdsCount: Y, selectedIds: [...]}"
```

## Key Methods Added

### 1. `getCurrentDataContext()`

Returns selection IDs of markers currently visible on the map (filtered data).

### 2. `compareSelectionIds(id1, id2)`

Robustly compares two selection IDs using multiple methods.

### 3. `showOnlyCurrentContextMarkers()`

Shows only markers that are in the current filtered context.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] First click on marker in filtered context shows only that marker
- [ ] Click on marker outside filtered context shows all filtered markers
- [ ] Multiple selections work correctly in filtered context
- [ ] Clearing selection shows only filtered markers
- [ ] Power BI filter integration works correctly
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] Debug messages appear as expected

## Performance Impact

- Minimal performance impact
- Additional context checking is lightweight
- Selection comparison is optimized
- No additional network requests

## Future Improvements

1. **Visual Feedback**: Add visual indication of filtered vs unfiltered markers
2. **Context Persistence**: Remember context across visual updates
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Support for complex filter combinations
4. **Context History**: Track filter changes for better UX
