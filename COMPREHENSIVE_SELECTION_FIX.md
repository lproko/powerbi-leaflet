# Comprehensive Selection Fix

## Problem Description

There were multiple issues with marker selection that persisted even after previous fixes:

1. **First click issue**: When clicking on a marker for the first time, sometimes the selection would be cleared but markers would stay hidden.

2. **Second click issue**: When clicking on a marker a second time to remove the filter (deselect), the other markers would stay hidden instead of showing all markers again.

3. **Visual recreation issue**: When Power BI had errors or data changes, the visual would be recreated, losing the selection state.

4. **JavaScript errors**: Errors in Power BI data processing were causing the visual to be recreated, which reset the selection state.

## Root Cause Analysis

The main issues were:

1. **Selection state loss**: When the visual was recreated due to errors or data changes, the selection state was lost
2. **Inconsistent deselection logic**: The logic for detecting deselection was not robust enough
3. **No error handling**: The visual update method had no error handling, causing crashes
4. **No persistent state**: Selection state was not persisted across visual updates

## Fix Applied

### 1. **Persistent Selection State**

- Added `persistentSelection: ISelectionId[]` property to track selection state across updates
- Added `restoreSelectionState()` method to restore selection after visual recreation
- Selection state is now preserved even when the visual is recreated

### 2. **Robust Error Handling**

```typescript
public update(options: VisualUpdateOptions) {
  try {
    // ... existing update logic ...

    // Restore previous selection state if needed
    this.restoreSelectionState();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in visual update:", error);
    // Fallback: show empty state if there's an error
    this.showEmptyState();
  }
}
```

### 3. **Improved Deselection Logic**

```typescript
// Handle the selection/deselection logic
if (ids.length === 0) {
  // No selection returned - this could be a deselection or error
  if (wasPreviouslySelected) {
    // This is a deselection - show all current context markers
    this.handleMarkerDeselection(i);
  } else {
    // This might be an error - show all current context markers
    this.updateMarkersVisibility(currentDataContext);
  }
} else if (!isCurrentlySelected) {
  // Selection returned but clicked marker is not in it
  // This is likely a deselection
  this.handleMarkerDeselection(i);
} else {
  // Show the selected markers
  this.updateMarkersVisibility(ids);
}
```

### 4. **State Management**

- Both `currentSelection` and `persistentSelection` are properly reset in all scenarios
- Selection state is cleared when visual is destroyed or has no data
- Selection state is restored after visual recreation

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Basic Selection and Deselection

1. Click on any marker for the first time
2. **Expected**: Only the clicked marker should be visible
3. Click on the same marker again
4. **Expected**: All markers in the current context should be visible

### Test 2: Visual Recreation Resilience

1. Click on a marker to select it
2. Trigger a data change or error in Power BI (causing visual recreation)
3. **Expected**: The selection should be preserved and markers should remain filtered
4. Click on the same marker again
5. **Expected**: All markers in the current context should be visible

### Test 3: Error Recovery

1. Click on a marker to select it
2. Introduce an error in Power BI data processing
3. **Expected**: Visual should handle the error gracefully and maintain selection state
4. Fix the error
5. **Expected**: Selection should be restored correctly

### Test 4: Multiple Selections

1. Click on multiple markers (Ctrl/Cmd+click)
2. Trigger a visual recreation
3. **Expected**: All selected markers should remain selected
4. Click on one of the selected markers
5. **Expected**: That marker should be deselected, others should remain selected

### Test 5: Filtered Context

1. Apply a filter in Power BI
2. Click on a marker in the filtered data
3. Trigger a visual recreation
4. **Expected**: Only the selected marker should be visible in the filtered context
5. Click on the same marker again
6. **Expected**: All markers in the current filtered context should be visible

## Console Logs to Monitor

Look for these log messages in the browser console:

```
"Marker clicked: index X, selectionId: [object]"
"Selection result: [array of selection IDs]"
"Current data context: [array of selection IDs]"
"Previous selection: [array of selection IDs]"
"Marker deselected - showing all current markers"
"Marker not in selection - showing all current markers"
"Showing selected markers"
"Restoring persistent selection state: [array of selection IDs]"
"Error in visual update: [error message]"
"Handling deselection for marker X"
"Showing only markers in current filtered context"
```

## Key Methods Added/Modified

### 1. `persistentSelection: ISelectionId[]`

Tracks selection state across visual updates and recreation.

### 2. `restoreSelectionState()`

Restores selection state after visual recreation.

### 3. Enhanced `update()` method

Added try-catch error handling and selection state restoration.

### 4. Improved marker click handler

More robust deselection detection and state management.

### 5. Enhanced state management

Proper cleanup and restoration of both current and persistent selection states.

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] First click on marker shows only that marker
- [ ] Second click on same marker shows all current context markers
- [ ] Selection state persists across visual recreation
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Multiple selections work correctly
- [ ] Filtered context is respected
- [ ] Selection state is properly cleared when appropriate
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in console
- [ ] Debug messages appear as expected

## Performance Impact

- Minimal performance impact
- Additional state tracking is lightweight
- Error handling prevents crashes
- No additional network requests

## Future Improvements

1. **Visual Feedback**: Add visual indication of persistent vs temporary selection
2. **Selection History**: Track selection history for undo/redo functionality
3. **Advanced Error Recovery**: More sophisticated error recovery mechanisms
4. **Selection Persistence**: Remember selections across Power BI sessions
